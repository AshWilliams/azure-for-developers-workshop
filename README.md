In this section we will add Sentiment Analysis to the reviews for our Hotels 360 app. For this, we will be leveraging the [Text Analytics API hosted by Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/?WT.mc_id=TechBash-github-bramin)

### 7 - [Azure Security](/labs/07-azure_security.md) ([Brandon Minnick](https://twitter.com/TheCodeTraveler))

In this section we will learn how to leverage the security tools available in Azure.

We'll start by learning more about [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/?WT.mc_id=TechBash-github-bramin) and how to leverage its recommendations to add extra layers of security to our app service.

Next, we'll move the secrets out our code and into [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/?WT.mc_id=TechBash-github-bramin). Key Vault leverages HSMs (hardware security modules) to help us avoid storing secrets in our source code.

### 8 - [Azure and Mobile]((/labs/08-azure_and_mobile.md)) (Brandon)

* High level overview of how .NET developers can leverage Xamarin
